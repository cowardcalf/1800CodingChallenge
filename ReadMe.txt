Program of 1800 Code Challenges of Aconex

Programmer: Yang Liu (yangliu0485@gmail.com)

Why choose this challenge:
	After reading the descriptions of these two challenges. There are two major reasons that I choose this one:
	1. The Vehicle survey has more ambiguous requirements than that of 1800. I have to assume two many details of 
	   what the client wanted. In real life cases we have to spend time talking with clients to know the details, 
	   but in a test, I want to know the question in details as much as possible to save time on
	   developing.
